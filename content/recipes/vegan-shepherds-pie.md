## Ingredients

- 1.3kg potato
- olive oil
- 1 onion (diced)
- garlic (minced)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1.5 cups brown or green lentils (rinsed and drained)
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- carrot, corn
- butter
- soy milk

## Instructions

### Mashed Potato

Peel potatoes and slice large ones in half. Bring to a boil on medium to high heat, generously salt, cover and cook for 20-30 minutes.

Thoroughly drain then transfer to a mixing bowl. Mash until smooth, adding butter and soy milk as needed. Season with salt and pepper. Loosely cover and set aside.

Preheat oven to 220Â°C.

### Filling

Saute onions and garlic in olive oil until lightly browned and caramelized (~5 minutes).

Add tomato paste, salt and pepper.

Add lentils, stock and thyme. Bring to a low boil. Cover and reduce heat to simmer. Continue cooking until lentils are tender (35-40 minutes).

Add corn and carrot in the last 10 minutes.

Once tender, drain liquid and continue to simmer lightly while stirring frequently to remove all liquid.

Adjust seasoning, pour into a greased baking dish, then spread the mash over.
