Some notes about [_Echopraxia_](https://www.librarything.com/work/14603863) (2014) by Peter Watts.

This book has been described elsewhere as a loose sequel to [_Blindsight_](librarything.com/work/1333265) (2006) but it's a fairly direct follow-up - narratively and thematically. I decided to read Blindsight after it was repeatedly mentioned by the hosts of [_Podside Picnic_](https://twitter.com/podsidep?lang=en) and Riley from [_Trash Future_](https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/). I'd been on a hard sci-fi binge consisting mostly of work by Greg Egan.

Both novels have a fantastic "notes and references" section at the end. Reading Watts in his own voice is a relief after 300 pages of K-holing dreamlike narration.

The protagonist Brüks names a hyper-intelligent time-sharing cognitive slime mold made from inorganic metal cells after _Portia_, a genus of hunting spiders:

> I'd like to start this section by emphasising how utterly cool _Portia's_ eight-legged namesake is in real life. That stuff about improvisational hunting strategies, mammalian-level problem-solving, and visual acuity all contained within a time-sharing bundle of neurons smaller than a pinhead - God's own truth, all of it.

Watts' notes on group minds are more thoughtful than anything in the text of the novel itself:

> Things get even messier when linked into networks, which can literally scatter one's mind even at today's rudimentary levels of connectivity. The "transactive memory system" called Google is already rewiring the parts of our brains that used to remember facts locally; now those circuits store search protocols for remote access of a distributed database. [[74]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/776.full) And google doesn't come anywhere close to the connectivity of a _real_ hive mind.
>
> Which is not to say that hive minds aren't already a ubiquitous part of Human society. _You_ are a hive mind, always have been: a single coherent consciousness spread across two cerebral hemispheres, each of which - when isolated - can run its own standalone, conscious entity with its own thoughts, aesthetics, even religious beliefs. The reverse also happens. A hemisphere forced to run solo when its partner is anaesthetised (preparatory to surgery, for instance) will manifest a different personality than the brain as a whole - but when those two hemispheres reconnected, that solo identity gets swallowed up by whatever dual-core persona runs on the whole organ. Consciousness expands to fill the space available.

Now I'm keen to reread _A Fire Upon the Deep_ (1992) by Vinge, which goes so far as to... embed these ideas in the narrative and the drama.

And finally, a note on free will, where he's going in even harder than in the notes on consciousness in _Blindsight_:

> Finally: free will. Although free will (rather, its lack) is one of _Echopraxia_'s central themes (the neurological condition of echopraxia is to autonomy as blindsight is to consciousness), I don't have much to say about it because the arguments seem so clear-cut as to be almost uninteresting. Neurons do not fire spontaneously, only in response to certain external stimulu; therefore brains cannot _act_ spontaneously, only in response to exertnal stimulu. No need to wade through all those studies that show the brain acting before the conscious mind "decides" to. Forget the revisionist interpretations that downgrade the definition from _free will_ to _will that's merely unpredictable enough to confuse predators_. It's simpler than that: the switch cannot flip itself. QED. If you insist on clinging to this _free will_ farce I'm not going to waste much time arguing here: plenty of others have made the case far more persuasively than I ever could.

I don't disagree with Watts here per se but this line of argument strikes me as little more than an elaboration of classic determinism; results from cognitive science aren't likely to convince someone one way or another if they've already reached a conclusion on the fundamental question of cause-and-effect.

I think many fans of Watts' work overstate the impact of the science. It's not compelling enough to make up for the obscure prose style, and I have to question leaning on the coda as a way to explain the novel as a whole.

A side note: in 2011, a good' friend of mine found a [fairly silly Tor review](https://www.tor.com/2011/03/03/best-sff-novels-of-the-decade-an-appreciation-of-blindsight/comment-page-1/) of _Blindsight_.

>  Watts is one of the crown princes of science fiction’s most difficult subgenre: his work is rigorous, unsentimental, and full of the sort of brilliant little moments of synthesis that make a nerd’s brain light up like a pinball machine. But he’s also a poet—a damned fine writer on a sentence level, who can make you feel the blank Lovecraftian indifference of the sea floor or of interplanetary space with the same ease facility with which he can pen an absolutely breathtaking passage of description.

Soon, _full of the sort of brilliant little moments of synthesis that make a nerd’s brain light up like a pinball machine_ was set up as a `phpbb` filter for the word "gameplay". This has proven an obstacle to getting anyone in that little community to read the book.
